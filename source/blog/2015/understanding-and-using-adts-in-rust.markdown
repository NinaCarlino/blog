The concept of ADTs (Algebraic Data Type) took me a long time to wrap my head around. I come from a Python background where ADTs are not a thing. When I finally figured out what was going on in ADT-land my growing comprehension of Rust-lang sort of snapped into place.

I decided to use FizzBuzz as an example because FizzBuzz  is simple and should feel familiar to most developers.

#### An enum

```rust
enum FizzedEnum {
    FizzBuzz,
    Fizz,
    Buzz,
    Int(isize),
}
```

This is an enum. Enums are Rust's ADT.

In Rust, an enum is a **type** which can only be in **one of a finite category of states**; the states with which the enum was defined.

Each of these states may or may not "wrap" an already existent type. For instance, a variable that is of the type FizzedEnum can be in the one of the following states:

+ FizzBuzz
+ Fizz
+ Buzz
+ Int(isize)

In the case of Int(isize), the FizzedEnum is in a state that wraps an integer of type isize.


#### A function that returns one type that can be many types


```rust
fn fizzer(num: isize)-> FizzedEnum {
    if num % 15 == 0     { FizzedEnum::FizzBuzz }
    else if num % 5 == 0 { FizzedEnum::Fizz }
    else if num % 3 == 0 { FizzedEnum::Buzz }
    else                 { FizzedEnum::Int(num) }
}
```
The logic for which category of FizzedEnum is returned from fizzer() follows the rules of FizzBuzz.

The above function **returns one type**, FizzedEnum, which **can be in
only one of the states** FizzBuzz, Fizz, Buzz, or Int. While the
first three members of the enum FizzedEnum have no contents the
fourth member, Int, wraps an integer of type isize.

This is a **VERY IMPORTANT** point: From this function the state of the
resulting FizzedEnum is returned. This resulting FizzedEnum type carries
information about its own state. **If the FizzedEnum is in the 'Int' state
it also carries the value of an integer**.

**Using this principle one may create functions that are capable of returning Enums that "carry" any type of data . This is the crux on which the principle of enums exists. This is their purpose.**


#### Matching on an Enum

This is the main function. The main function is executed when the Rust binary is executed.

```rust
fn main() {
    for num in 1..25 {
        let result = fizzer(num);
        match result {
            FizzedEnum::FizzBuzz  => println!("FizzBuzz"),
            FizzedEnum::Fizz      => println!("Fizz"),
            FizzedEnum::Buzz      => println!("Buzz"),
            FizzedEnum::Int(x)    => println!("{:?}", x),
        }
    }
}
```
In main() we iterate through a range of numbers between 1 and 25 (exclusive). On each iteration we:

1. pass the variable num into the fizzer function
2. use Rustâ€™s match statement to branch according to the state of the result
3. println! the appropriate message

Notice that the match statement above required no underscore/catch-all clause to compile. When matching the variable 'result' (which is of type FizzedEnum) it can only be in one of four states FizzBuzz, Fizz, Buzz, or Int. The match statement in Rust must be exhaustive, and this one is.

##### Conclusion

TL;DR - Just read the bold parts.

I really hope this example has helped you understand the use case and purpose of ADTs.
