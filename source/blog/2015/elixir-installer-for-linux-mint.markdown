For a while now I've been pushing/harassing Rick to learn and adopt [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org).

I've been using Elixir for a few months and I find coding in Elixir to be a truely enjoyable experience. I've tried convincing Rick that Elixir is [worth learning](http://www.creativedeletion.com/2015/04/19/elixir_next_language.html) and [only getting better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqo9-pQuRKE&feature=youtu.be&t=2009).

Both Rick and I are avid users of Linux Mint. After experiencing some issues with the [Elixir-lang.org installation instructions](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html) I decided to write a script that could be used to install Elixir in one step.

Using the new script is easy. [Click here to visit the repo](https://github.com/DataMelon/install-elixir-1.0.4) or follow these instructions.


#### Installation

Make sure when you clone this repo that the files will persist (not a tmp/ dir).

In bash:

1. ```git clone https://github.com/DataMelon/install-elixir-1.0.4.git```
1. ```cd install-elixir-1.0.4.git```
1. ```chmod u+x install_erlang_and_elixir.sh```
1. ```sudo ./install_erlang_and_elixir.sh```
1. Logout and Log in.

#### Conclusion

That's all for now. Enjoy building amazing software with Elixir.
